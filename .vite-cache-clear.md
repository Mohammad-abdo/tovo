# Clear Vite Cache

If you're experiencing HMR (Hot Module Reload) errors, try these steps:

1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete the `.vite` folder in the frontend directory
3. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

Alternatively, you can clear the cache by running:
- Windows PowerShell: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .vite`
- Or manually delete the `.vite` folder
